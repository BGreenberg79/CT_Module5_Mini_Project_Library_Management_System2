# Library Management System
## Programmed by Benjamin Greenberg
Mini-Project for Coding Temple

## Project Overview
The Library Management System is a python coding project designed to use Object Oriented Programming to efficiently organize books for any type of library ranging from a small personal collection to a larger municipal or university collection. This project uses a main module that houses the main logic of the program but imports Class objects and methods for each of those objects for Books, Authors, Genres, and Users. Notably the Book class uses inheritance to work in tandem with the Genre class allowing us to easily group books about similar topcis or themes together. The main module stores instances of each of those four different Class types either in lists \(for Genre and Author\) or in dictionaries \(for User and Book\). My program will allow the user to easily and seamlessly add instances for any of the four classes, as well as display the contents of this management system navigating by each of the four classes. This porgram will also allow the library to keep track of which books have been borrowed and which books have been returned by each individual member within their library system.
